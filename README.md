# Ai-quality-control-management
1.Project demonstration
Overview:
This project simulates a small-scale manufacturing process (e.g., bottle cap production) where quality control techniques are implemented to monitor and control the quality of output. The focus will be on identifying defects, analyzing root causes, and improving process consistency using QC tools.
2.Project Demonstration Details:
A. Inspection:
•	Visual inspection for defects: cracks, deformations, color mismatch
•	Dimensional check using Vernier calipers
B. Control Chart Implementation:
•	Measured cap diameters recorded for 50 samples
•	X-bar and R-chart plotted to monitor process stability
C. Defect Analysis:
•	Defects recorded over 3 days
•	Pareto chart used to identify most common defects
•	Fishbone diagram used for root cause analysis

Outcome:
•	Defect rate reduced from 7.5% to 2.3%
•	Increased product consistency
•	Improved operator awareness of quality issues
